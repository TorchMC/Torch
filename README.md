# Torch
The main repository of TorchSpigot

Torch is a open-source project for creating a Minecraft Server implementation that is multi-threaded and allows modifications through what we call "plugins". Torch is super fast at updating, because we inject directly into the default Minecraft Server. We could even make builds for snapshots! Torch is also good at using all of your allocated resources such as the CPU's threads, that also means that your server will be faster than using other server modifications such as Spigot, Sponge, Glowstone, and Glowstone++!
